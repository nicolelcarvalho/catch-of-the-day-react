/*

Notes:

npm start to start up React 

Fragment allows you to render multiple sibling elements within a component

Always remember to export your componenet with export default ComponentName

Component classes are capitalized

Stateless components are used when your component only has a render method and maybe props
Stateless components are variables, so use const and you can pass in your props as an argument. When passing props, you don't need this, you can reference your prop without the keyword this

destructure your props by using ({ })
example: props.tagline, props.age would be refereced ({ tagline, age }), then you can just use the name of the prop instead of prop.tagline


Tools to look into:

commenting out in React
